In the beginning of electrification, switching between electrical devices is done by either connecting or disconnecting them to the power grid. Now-a-days disconnecting a device from its energy source become less popular. And also, there may be a chance to get an electric shock, when the human being is trying to disconnect a device without any precautions. So, switching between electrical device can be made electrically(automatically). This gives an easy way to switch the device (powered ‘on’ or ‘off’) by a remote-control unit or an automated switching circuit based on the number of persons inside in the particular room. So that the electricity consumption is reduced in the absence of persons. 
This project presents the workflow to design the Energy Saver using IR sensor to reduce the electricity consumption especially in the class room and give an emergency alarm when fire is detected inside.
