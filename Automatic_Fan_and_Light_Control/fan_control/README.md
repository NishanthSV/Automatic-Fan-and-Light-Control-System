# Embedded-System
Consider a class room, where there is a chance of high probability that the students might be fail to switch off the fans and lights due to the carelessness. So, the lot of electricity is wasted until manually switch off the fans and lights. This project provides the system which will be focusing on such an issue. This Energy Saver using PIR sensor is used to switch ‘off’ the fans and lights in the absence of students. When a student enters the classroom, the Infrared energy emitted from the living body is focused by the Fresnel lens segment and the PIR sensors were activated and give to the microcontroller which acts as power saving device according to the relay. When motion is detected, it triggers and switch the fan and light ‘on’. If no motion has not been detected, the system will switch ‘off; the fans and lights after 10 minutes. The fan only switches ‘on’ when the room attains a temperature of 25-40-degree C. The speed of fan can be controlled based on the room temperature.
